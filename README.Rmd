A mini-package for creating bar plots with rounded corners using ggplot2.

## Installation

Install the released version of ggrounded from CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggrounded")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("botan/ggrounded")
```

## Usage

There are two types of bar charts in ggplot2: `geom_bar()` and `geom_col()`. `geom_bar_rounded()` and `geom_col_rounded()` are wrappers on them for rounding the top corners. `geom_bar_rounded()` makes the height of the bar proportional to the number of cases in each group (or if the `weight` aesthetic is supplied, the sum of the weights). 

```{r example1}
library(ggrounded)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mpg, aes(class)) +
  geom_bar_rounded()
```

 If you want the heights of the bars to represent values in the data, use `geom_col_rounded()` instead.

```{r example2}
ggplot(data.frame(x = letters[1:3], y = c(2.3, 1.9, 3.2)), aes(x, y)) +
  geom_col_rounded()
```
